    "In this chapter, we will learn how to value treasury futures contracts using QuantLib. The treasury futures contract gives the buyer the right to buy the underlying by the time the contract expires. The underlying is usually delivered from a basket of securities. So in order to properly value the futures contract, we would need to find the deliverable. Here we start by doing a naive calculation by constructing a fictional security. We will see what is wrong about this approach. As a next step we will perform the cheapest to deliver calculation and subsequently use that deliverable to value the same contract."
