The one against using the forecast index fixing goes that the rate would be accrued over a period which is different from the one over which it was calculated, and thus it will require a small convexity adjustment.  Personally, the argument failed to persuade me, since with par coupons we're using the wrong rate over the right period and therefore we're introducing an error anyway; I doubt that it's smaller than the missing convexity adjustment.  Moreover, the value of the swap is going to jump as soon as the coupon rate is actually fixed, forcing an adjustment of the P&L."
